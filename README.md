## Example

### Adding a note
Notes are added either as a simple inline virtual comment (if no body is supplied), or with a full body, like in the picture below:

<img width="1162" height="967" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/732aef70-3b92-493f-8871-e7380792f31b" />

### Finding notes

Ghost notes you have made can be found by using `leader + gnf` to find ALL your ghost notes, or `leader + gnF` to find ghost notes in your current project.
If you have telescope or snacks installed you will be able to preview the notes as well - see below:

<img width="1163" height="957" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7126a2fc-4648-4d20-90f9-622d55f82ccb" />

If neither telescope nor snacks is installed you will get a simple picker that lets you see the headline and also moves you to the location of the note when picked.
