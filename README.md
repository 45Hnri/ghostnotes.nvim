## Example

### Adding a note
Notes are added either as a simple inline virtual comment (if no body is supplied), or with a full body, like in the picture below:

### Finding notes

Ghost notes you have made can be found by using `leader + gnf` to find ALL your ghost notes, or `leader + gnF` to find ghost notes in your current project. You can also grep for content inside notes by doing `leader + gng` or `leader + gnG`.

If neither telescope nor snacks is installed you will get a simple picker that lets you see the headline and also moves you to the location of the note when picked. Grepping will not work without telescope / snacks.
